## Installation

```bash
cargo build --release
```

## OAuth2 Setup

### Strava

1. Create a Strava application at https://www.strava.com/settings/api
2. Note your Client ID and Client Secret
3. Run the auth setup tool:

```bash
cargo run --bin auth-setup -- strava \
  --client-id YOUR_CLIENT_ID \
  --client-secret YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET
```

4. Follow the browser prompts to authorize the application
5. The tool will save your tokens to the config file

### Fitbit

1. Create a Fitbit application at https://dev.fitbit.com/apps/new
   - **Application Type**: Personal
   - **OAuth 2.0 Application Type**: Confidential
   - **Redirect URL**: `http://localhost:8080/callback` (or your callback URL)
   - **Default Access Type**: Read Only
2. Note your Client ID and Client Secret
3. Run the auth setup tool:

```bash
cargo run --bin auth-setup -- fitbit \
  --client-id YOUR_CLIENT_ID \
  --client-secret YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET
```

4. Follow the browser prompts to authorize the application
5. The tool will save your tokens to the config file

**Note**: Fitbit requires explicit scopes. The server requests `activity`, `profile`, and `sleep` permissions.

## Weather Integration

The server includes comprehensive weather integration that automatically enhances activity analysis with contextual weather data.

### Features

- ‚úÖ **Real-time Weather**: Current weather data from OpenWeatherMap
- ‚úÖ **Historical Weather**: Historical weather data for past activities (with subscription)
- ‚úÖ **GPS-Based**: Extracts coordinates from activity start locations
- ‚úÖ **Smart Fallback**: Intelligent mock weather when API unavailable
- ‚úÖ **Activity Intelligence**: Weather context in activity summaries
- ‚úÖ **Impact Analysis**: Weather difficulty and performance adjustments

### Setup (Optional)

Weather integration works out-of-the-box with realistic mock weather patterns. For real weather data:

1. **Get OpenWeatherMap API Key** (free tier available)
   - Visit https://openweathermap.org/api
   - Sign up for free account
   - Copy your API key

2. **Set Environment Variable**
   ```bash
   export OPENWEATHER_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
   ```

3. **Configure Settings** (optional)
   Edit `fitness_config.toml`:
   ```toml
   [weather_api]
   provider = "openweathermap"
   enabled = true
   cache_duration_hours = 24
   fallback_to_mock = true
   ```

### Weather Intelligence Examples

With weather integration, activity analysis includes contextual insights:

```json
{
  "summary": "Morning run in the rain with moderate intensity",
  "contextual_factors": {
    "weather": {
      "temperature_celsius": 15.2,
      "humidity_percentage": 85.0,
      "wind_speed_kmh": 12.5,
      "conditions": "rain"
    },
    "time_of_day": "morning"
  }
}
```

### Weather Features

| Feature | Free Tier | Paid Tier |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| **Mock Weather** | ‚úÖ Realistic patterns | ‚úÖ Available |
| **Current Weather** | ‚úÖ Real-time data | ‚úÖ Real-time data |
| **Historical Weather** | üé≠ Mock fallback | ‚úÖ Real historical data |
| **API Calls** | 1,000/day free | Unlimited with subscription |
| **Production Ready** | ‚úÖ Zero costs | ‚úÖ Precise data |

## MCP Tools

The server exposes the following tools for all supported providers:

- `get_activities`: Fetch fitness activities from a provider (supports pagination with limit/offset)
  - **Providers**: `strava`, `fitbit`
  - **Strava**: Uses activity list API with pagination
  - **Fitbit**: Uses date-based activity queries (last 30 days by default)
- `get_athlete`: Get athlete profile information
  - **Strava**: Returns detailed athlete profile with avatar
  - **Fitbit**: Returns user profile with display name and avatar
- `get_stats`: Get aggregated statistics
  - **Strava**: Uses athlete stats API with activity-based fallback
  - **Fitbit**: Uses lifetime stats API with floor-to-elevation conversion
