# Pierre MCP Server

A comprehensive MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for fitness data analysis. Provides secure access to fitness data from multiple providers (Strava, Fitbit) through Claude and other AI assistants.

## LLM Prompt Examples

Once connected to Claude or another AI assistant, you can use natural language prompts to analyze your fitness data:

### üèÉ Running Analysis
```
What was my longest run this year?

Analyze my running pace trends over the last 3 months.

How many miles did I run in total last month?

What's my average weekly running distance?

Find my fastest 5K time this year.
```

### üö¥ Cross-Training Analysis
```
Compare my cycling vs running activities this month.

What's my most active day of the week?

Show me my heart rate zones during my last 5 workouts.

How has my fitness improved over the last 6 months?

What's my longest consecutive streak of workouts?
```

### üìä Fitness Insights
```
Create a summary of my fitness goals progress.

What activities burn the most calories for me?

Analyze my workout patterns and suggest improvements.

How does my Strava data compare to my Fitbit data?

What's my average elevation gain per week?
```

### üéØ Goal Tracking
```
How close am I to running 1000 miles this year?

Track my progress toward my weekly activity goals.

What's my personal best for each activity type?

Show me days where I exceeded 10,000 steps.

Find patterns in my rest days vs active days.
```

### üìà Advanced Analysis
```
Correlate my workout intensity with my recovery time.

What's the optimal workout frequency based on my data?

Analyze seasonal patterns in my activity levels.

Compare my performance before and after equipment changes.

Identify my most and least consistent months for training.
```

## Features

- **Multi-Provider Support**: Strava and Fitbit integration with unified API
- **Enhanced Security**: OAuth2 authentication with PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange)
- **Comprehensive Data Access**: Activities, athlete profiles, and aggregated statistics
- **MCP Protocol Compliance**: Works seamlessly with Claude and GitHub Copilot
- **Extensible Design**: Easy to add new fitness providers in the future
- **Production Ready**: Comprehensive testing and clean error handling

## Installation

```bash
cargo build --release
```

## OAuth2 Setup

### Strava

1. Create a Strava application at https://www.strava.com/settings/api
2. Note your Client ID and Client Secret
3. Run the auth setup tool:

```bash
cargo run --bin auth-setup -- strava \
  --client-id YOUR_CLIENT_ID \
  --client-secret YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET
```

4. Follow the browser prompts to authorize the application
5. The tool will save your tokens to the config file

### Fitbit

1. Create a Fitbit application at https://dev.fitbit.com/apps/new
   - **Application Type**: Personal
   - **OAuth 2.0 Application Type**: Confidential
   - **Redirect URL**: `http://localhost:8080/callback` (or your callback URL)
   - **Default Access Type**: Read Only
2. Note your Client ID and Client Secret
3. Run the auth setup tool:

```bash
cargo run --bin auth-setup -- fitbit \
  --client-id YOUR_CLIENT_ID \
  --client-secret YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET
```

4. Follow the browser prompts to authorize the application
5. The tool will save your tokens to the config file

**Note**: Fitbit requires explicit scopes. The server requests `activity`, `profile`, and `sleep` permissions.

## Configuration

The server supports multiple configuration methods:

### Using direnv (.envrc):
```bash
# Copy the example file
cp .envrc.example .envrc

# Edit with your credentials
vim .envrc

# Allow direnv to load the file
direnv allow
```

### Using .env file:
```env
# Strava Configuration
STRAVA_CLIENT_ID=your_strava_client_id
STRAVA_CLIENT_SECRET=your_strava_client_secret
STRAVA_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_strava_access_token
STRAVA_REFRESH_TOKEN=your_strava_refresh_token

# Fitbit Configuration
FITBIT_CLIENT_ID=your_fitbit_client_id
FITBIT_CLIENT_SECRET=your_fitbit_client_secret
FITBIT_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_fitbit_access_token
FITBIT_REFRESH_TOKEN=your_fitbit_refresh_token
```

### Using config.toml:
```toml
[providers.strava]
auth_type = "oauth2"
client_id = "your_strava_client_id"
client_secret = "your_strava_client_secret"
access_token = "your_strava_access_token"
refresh_token = "your_strava_refresh_token"

[providers.fitbit]
auth_type = "oauth2"
client_id = "your_fitbit_client_id"
client_secret = "your_fitbit_client_secret"
access_token = "your_fitbit_access_token"
refresh_token = "your_fitbit_refresh_token"
```

## Usage

```bash
# Run with default settings
cargo run

# Run with custom port
cargo run -- --port 9000

# Run with custom config file
cargo run -- --config /path/to/config.toml
```

## MCP Tools

The server exposes the following tools for all supported providers:

- `get_activities`: Fetch fitness activities from a provider (supports pagination with limit/offset)
  - **Providers**: `strava`, `fitbit`
  - **Strava**: Uses activity list API with pagination
  - **Fitbit**: Uses date-based activity queries (last 30 days by default)
- `get_athlete`: Get athlete profile information
  - **Strava**: Returns detailed athlete profile with avatar
  - **Fitbit**: Returns user profile with display name and avatar
- `get_stats`: Get aggregated statistics
  - **Strava**: Uses athlete stats API with activity-based fallback
  - **Fitbit**: Uses lifetime stats API with floor-to-elevation conversion

### Example Usage

```bash
# Test the server with example queries
cargo run --bin find-2025-longest-run
cargo run --bin find-2024-longest-run
cargo run --bin find-consecutive-10k-runs

# Example MCP tool calls:
# {"method": "tools/call", "params": {"name": "get_activities", "arguments": {"provider": "strava", "limit": 10}}}
# {"method": "tools/call", "params": {"name": "get_activities", "arguments": {"provider": "fitbit", "limit": 20}}}
# {"method": "tools/call", "params": {"name": "get_athlete", "arguments": {"provider": "strava"}}}
```

## Adding to Claude or GitHub Copilot

Add to your MCP configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pierre-fitness": {
      "command": "path/to/pierre-mcp-server",
      "args": ["--port", "8080"]
    }
  }
}
```

Or for development:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pierre-fitness-dev": {
      "command": "cargo",
      "args": ["run", "--", "--port", "8080"],
      "cwd": "/path/to/pierre_mcp_server"
    }
  }
