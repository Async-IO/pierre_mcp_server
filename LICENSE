## Contribution

Unless you explicitly state otherwise, any contribution intentionally submitted
for inclusion in the work by you, as defined in the Apache-2.0 license, shall be
dual licensed as above, without any additional terms or conditions.

## Why Dual Licensing?

This dual licensing approach follows the standard practice in the Rust ecosystem 
and provides maximum flexibility:

- **MIT License**: Offers maximum permissiveness and simplicity
- **Apache 2.0 License**: Provides explicit patent grants and contributor protections
- **User Choice**: Downstream users can choose whichever license better fits their needs
- **Ecosystem Compatibility**: Compatible with virtually all open source and proprietary projects

Choose the license that best fits your project's requirements. Both licenses are 
OSI-approved and widely used in the software industry.
