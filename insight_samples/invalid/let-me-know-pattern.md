## Content
Let me know if you have any other questions about your training plan. I'm happy to help you optimize your workout schedule and recovery strategies. Is there anything specific you'd like me to explain?

## Reason
Contains multiple generic assistant response patterns: "Let me know if", "I'm happy to help", "Is there anything". This is clearly assistant conversational filler rather than a genuine fitness insight. Should be caught by the quick rejection patterns.
