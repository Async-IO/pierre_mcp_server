## Content
Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.

## Reason
Generic motivational quote with no personal training context, no data, and no fitness-specific insight. While motivational content can be valid, it must include personal training context or achievements. This is just a famous quote without any connection to the user's actual training.
