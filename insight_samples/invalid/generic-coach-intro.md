## Content
How can I assist your training today? I'm here to help you achieve your fitness goals. Feel free to ask me anything about your workouts, nutrition, or recovery strategies.

## Reason
This is a generic AI assistant introduction with no fitness-specific content. It contains common patterns like "How can I assist" and "I'm here to help" which indicate placeholder text rather than genuine training insights. Should be rejected for all tiers as it provides no value to the social feed.
