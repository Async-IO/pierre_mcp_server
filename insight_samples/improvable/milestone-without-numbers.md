## Content
Big milestone this month! I've been cycling more consistently than ever and can really feel the difference in my legs. The long rides are getting easier and I'm climbing better than before.

## Reason
Genuine training progress with good narrative, but lacks quantification. What's the milestone? How much more consistently? What distance are the long rides? How much better on climbs? Premium tiers should receive an improved version that prompts the user to add specific metrics while preserving their voice and enthusiasm.
