## Content
Started doing more drills in the pool and it's helping my technique. My stroke feels more efficient and I'm less tired at the end of my swims. Definitely worth spending the time on fundamentals.

## Reason
Good training tip with genuine experience, but lacks specificity. What drills? How much time spent? How much improvement in pace or distance? For premium tiers, the improved version should encourage adding specific drill names, frequency, and measurable improvements while maintaining the authentic voice.
