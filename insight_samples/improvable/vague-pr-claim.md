## Content
Finally got a new PR on my morning run! Felt really strong the whole way. The training has been paying off and I'm excited to keep pushing.

## Reason
Has good intent and mentions a PR achievement, but lacks specific data (what distance? what time? how much improvement?). For Starter tier, this passes as-is because it's genuine content. For Professional/Enterprise tiers, the LLM should suggest adding the actual time and distance to make it more valuable for readers.
