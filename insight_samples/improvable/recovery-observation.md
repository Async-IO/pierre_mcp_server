## Content
Taking recovery more seriously lately. Sleep has been better and I'm not as sore after hard workouts. Think the extra stretching and foam rolling is making a difference.

## Reason
Valid recovery-focused content with genuine observations, but could be more data-driven. For premium tiers, could be improved to mention specific sleep metrics, recovery routine duration, or HRV trends if available. The original intent and voice should be preserved while adding actionable specificity.
