## Content
Just crushed my 10K PR! Finished in 45:32, taking 47 seconds off my previous best. Paced it perfectly - first 5K in 22:58, second in 22:34. Negative split for the win! Heart rate averaged 168 bpm, peaked at 182 in the final kilometer. All that threshold work is paying off.

## Reason
This insight contains specific metrics (time, splits, heart rate data), demonstrates training context (threshold work), and shares a genuine achievement with quantifiable data. This is exactly the type of data-driven content that should be shared on the social feed.
