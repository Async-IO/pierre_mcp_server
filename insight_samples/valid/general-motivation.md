## Content
Consistency beats intensity every time. After months of showing up even on days I didn't feel like it, I can feel the difference in my running. The easy runs feel easier, the hard workouts feel more manageable, and race day doesn't feel as intimidating. Trust the process!

## Reason
This insight contains valuable training philosophy without any specific metrics. It would pass validation under ANY sharing policy (DataRich, Sanitized, or GeneralOnly) because there are no numbers to redact or hide. Good example of shareable content that works for all users.
