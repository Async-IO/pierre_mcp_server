## Content
Hit 60 miles this week for the first time in marathon training! CTL climbed to 47, up from 38 six weeks ago. Long run was 18 miles at 8:45/mile pace with HR staying in Zone 2 the whole time. Building that aerobic base feels solid. Three more weeks of building before the taper begins.

## Reason
Contains specific training metrics (weekly mileage, CTL, pace, heart rate zones), demonstrates structured training context (marathon preparation, taper planning), and shares meaningful progress data that other athletes would find valuable.
