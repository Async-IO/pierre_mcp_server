## Content
Recovery metrics looking strong after last week's big training block. HRV jumped from 42ms to 58ms over the past 3 days. Sleep quality averaged 87% with 2.5 hours of deep sleep per night. Resting heart rate dropped from 52 to 48 bpm. Body is adapting well - time to add some intensity back in.

## Reason
Contains specific physiological data (HRV values, sleep metrics, resting heart rate), shows understanding of recovery principles, and demonstrates data-driven decision making about training progression. Valuable content for athletes tracking their own recovery.
