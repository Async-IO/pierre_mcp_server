## Content
New FTP of 285W after today's ramp test! That's up 15W from 270W eight weeks ago. Watts per kilo now at 3.8 w/kg. The structured sweet spot work (3x20 at 88-94% FTP) has been brutal but clearly effective. Ready to tackle those local climbs with fresh legs and new power zones.

## Reason
Highly specific cycling performance data (FTP, watts per kg, training percentages), clear progress quantification (15W improvement), and references specific training methodology. Exactly the kind of data-driven cycling content that provides value to the community.
