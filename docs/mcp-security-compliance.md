# MCP Security Compliance Guide

This guide documents the security implementation and compliance measures for Pierre MCP Server's Model Context Protocol integration.

## Security Architecture Overview

Pierre MCP Server implements security controls across multiple layers to ensure safe data handling and MCP protocol compliance.

### Core Security Principles

1. Explicit User Consent: All data access requires explicit user authorization
2. Data Minimization: Only collect and process necessary fitness data
3. Encryption Everywhere: Data encrypted in transit and at rest
4. Audit Trail: Complete logging of all security-relevant operations

## Authentication & Authorization

### JWT-Based Authentication

The server uses JWT tokens for secure authentication:

```bash
# Authentication flow example
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/admin/setup \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"admin_name": "admin", "admin_email": "admin@example.com"}'
```

Security Features:
- Configurable token expiration (default: 24 hours)
- Secure token storage with HttpOnly cookies
- Rate limiting on authentication attempts
- Automatic token refresh mechanism

### Multi-Tenant Isolation

Each tenant operates in complete isolation:
- Separate API credentials per tenant
- Data segregation at database level
- Tenant-specific OAuth configurations
- Independent rate limiting per tenant

## Data Protection

### Encryption Standards

In Transit:
- TLS 1.3 for all HTTP/WebSocket communications
- Certificate validation for external API calls
- Perfect Forward Secrecy for all connections

At Rest:
- AES-256-GCM encryption for sensitive data
- Two-tier key management system
- Hardware Security Module (HSM) support
- Secure key rotation procedures

### Data Access Controls

All fitness data access requires explicit consent verification:

```rust
// Example: Consent-aware data access
pub async fn get_user_activities(&self, user_id: Uuid, consent_token: &str) -> Result<Vec<Activity>> {
    // Verify explicit consent for data access
    self.verify_data_access_consent(user_id, consent_token, DataType::Activities).await?;
    
    // Log access for audit trail
    self.audit_log.record_data_access(user_id, DataType::Activities).await;
    
    // Proceed with secure data retrieval
    self.fetch_activities_with_limits(user_id).await
}
```

## MCP-Specific Security

### Protocol Compliance

Version Negotiation:
- Supports MCP versions: `2025-06-18`, `2024-11-05`
- Proper version validation during initialization
- Graceful handling of unsupported versions

Capability Declaration:
- Accurate server capabilities reporting
- Resource availability transparency
- Tool functionality disclosure

### Progress Tracking Security

Long-running operations use secure progress tracking:

```bash
# Operation with progress tracking
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "get_activities",
    "arguments": {"provider": "strava", "limit": 50}
  },
  "id": 1
}
```

Security Features:
- UUID-based progress tokens
- Cancellation support for user control
- Secure progress state management
- Audit logging of all operations

### Error Handling

MCP-compliant error responses protect sensitive information:

- Authentication Errors: Generic messages to prevent user enumeration
- Authorization Errors: Clear scope-based error descriptions
- Tool Execution Errors: Sanitized error messages
- Progress Tracking Errors: Secure token validation

## User Consent Framework

### Consent Types

The system implements granular consent management:

1. Data Access Consent: Permission to read fitness data
2. Data Processing Consent: Permission to analyze and generate insights  
3. Data Transmission Consent: Permission to share data with third parties
4. Tool Execution Consent: Permission to execute specific fitness tools

### Consent Verification Process

```bash
# Consent verification before data access
POST /consent/verify
{
  "user_id": "uuid",
  "operation": "get_activities",
  "scope": ["strava:activities", "analytics:insights"],
  "consent_token": "secure-consent-token"
}
```

### Consent Withdrawal

Users maintain full control over their consent:

- Immediate Effect: Consent withdrawal takes effect immediately
- Data Cleanup: Option to delete associated data
- Audit Trail: Complete history of consent changes
- Granular Control: Specific scope-based consent management

## Privacy Protection

### Data Minimization

The server implements strict data collection limits:

- Purpose Limitation: Data used only for specified fitness analysis
- Storage Limitation: Data retained only as long as necessary
- Access Limitation: Access restricted to minimum required operations

### Personal Data Classification

Highly Sensitive:
- Heart rate and health metrics
- Location data and GPS tracks
- Personal identifiers and demographics

Moderately Sensitive:
- Activity summaries and performance data
- Training insights and recommendations
- Aggregated fitness statistics

Low Sensitivity:
- Anonymous usage statistics
- System performance metrics
- Public activity metadata

### Privacy Controls Implementation

```rust
pub async fn apply_privacy_controls(
    &self,
    data: &mut FitnessData,
    privacy_level: PrivacyLevel,
) -> Result<()> {
    match privacy_level {
        PrivacyLevel::High => {
            self.anonymize_identifiers(data).await?;
            self.remove_location_data(data).await?;
            self.generalize_timestamps(data).await?;
        }
        PrivacyLevel::Medium => {
            self.pseudonymize_identifiers(data).await?;
            self.coarsen_location_data(data).await?;
        }
        PrivacyLevel::Low => {
            self.audit_data_access(data).await?;
        }
    }
    Ok(())
}
```

## Threat Mitigation
