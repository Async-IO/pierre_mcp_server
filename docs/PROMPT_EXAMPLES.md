## Pro Tips for Effective Prompts

### Best Practices
- **Be specific about timeframes**: "last 3 months" vs "recently"
- **Include context requests**: "with weather data" or "including location analysis"
- **Ask for actionable insights**: "suggest improvements" or "recommend changes"
- **Combine multiple data points**: location + weather + performance

### Advanced Prompt Techniques
- **Comparative analysis**: "Compare A vs B with environmental context"
- **Pattern recognition**: "Find patterns between X and Y over time"
- **Predictive queries**: "Based on my data, what would happen if..."
- **Optimization requests**: "What's the optimal X for achieving Y?"

### Sample Multi-layered Query
```
Analyze my marathon performance over the past 2 years, including:
- Location and terrain impact on finish times
- Weather conditions during each race
- Training load in the 12 weeks before each marathon
- Recovery patterns post-race
